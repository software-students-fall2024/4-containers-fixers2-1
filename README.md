# App Description 

Our project is a real-time traffic monitoring dashboard focused on New York City's 5th Avenue. Using a live camera feed, the system identifies and counts different types of vehicles, such as cars, trucks, and buses, on this busy street. This data is then processed and displayed on a web dashboard, providing an up-to-date view of traffic conditions.

The dashboard shows the current number of each type of vehicle and an overall congestion level, which changes color based on traffic conditions (e.g., green for low, yellow for moderate, and red for heavy traffic). This setup allows anyone to get a quick sense of how busy 5th Avenue is at any given moment, potentially helping city planners, residents, and visitors make informed decisions about travelling in this area.
